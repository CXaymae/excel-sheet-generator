Enhanced User Alerts with SweetAlert.js

In this project, SweetAlert.js library has been incorporated to provide enhanced user alerts for better user experience. Two specific scenarios have been addressed using SweetAlert.js:

1. Empty Fields Alert: When the user clicks the "Generate" button without filling in all the required fields, an alert is displayed using SweetAlert.js. This alert reminds the user to fill in all the necessary information before generating the desired output.

2. Export Table Alert: When the user clicks the "Export" button without any generated table to export, an alert is shown using SweetAlert.js. This alert notifies the user that there is no table available for export and prompts them to generate the table first.

By utilizing SweetAlert.js, this project enhances the user interface by providing visually appealing and user-friendly alerts. These alerts ensure that the user receives clear and informative messages, helping them to take appropriate actions and interact effectively with the application.
